# Atomic Traceable Documentation (ATD) — Reference Manual

> **Audience:** IDE agents, developers, and CI tooling.
> **Purpose:** Establish the canonical rules for **when** and **how** to use ATD within a development environment.
> **Primary objective:** Maintain high-level traceability from **Customer requirements** → **Architecture** → **Code** → **Tests** (`@spec-link` + `@test-link`).

## 1. How ATD Works

### 1.1 Philosophy

ATD turns Markdown documentation into a **Development Governance System**. Five principles govern the framework:

| # | Principle | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Minimum Atomic Scale** | Each atom describes exactly ONE state-changing rule. If an intent needs "and" or "also", split it. |
| 2 | **Bidirectional Traceability** | Every atom links to code via `@spec-link [[atom_id]]` tags and to tests via `@test-link [[atom_id]]` tags; every code module links back to its governing atom. This creates a verifiable chain: Customer requirement → Architecture → Implementation → Test. |
| 3 | **Doc-Code Co-evolution** | During **cold-start** (bootstrapping an undocumented codebase), atoms are extracted FROM existing implementations — the code is the initial source of truth. Once the initial ATD base is established, **documentation and code evolve together**: new features begin as `DRAFT` atoms (requirements, specs, design) before implementation, and implementation feeds back into atom refinement. Neither side is subordinate; they are kept in sync through the verification loop. |
| 4 | **LLM-Assisted, Human-Governed** | Local/remote LLMs handle bulk extraction and auditing. The IDE Agent handles high-intelligence tasks. Humans govern final architecture. |
| 5 | **Token Economy** | Every LLM interaction is metered by task type. Cheap tasks (embedding, pass/fail) run locally. Expensive generation tasks run on capable models. Deterministic tasks (weaving, crawling, updating) never touch an LLM. |

### 1.2 The Atom

An **Atom** is a single-responsibility Markdown file (`.atom.md`) with a strict YAML frontmatter followed by four mandatory sections.

#### Template

```markdown
---
id: unique_slug
human_name: "Human Readable Name"
type: MECHANIC
layer: IMPLEMENTATION
version: 1.0
status: DRAFT
priority: 3
tags: [tag1, tag2]
parents:
  - [[parent_atom_id]]
dependents:
  - [[child_atom_id]]
---

# Human Readable Name

## INTENT
[One sentence: Why does this exist?]

## THE RULE / LOGIC
[The core specification. Use pseudo-code, formulas, or strict bullet points.]

## TECHNICAL INTERFACE (The Bridge)
- **API Endpoint:** `POST /v1/example`
- **Code Tag:** `@spec-link [[unique_slug]]`
- **Related Issue:** `#123`
- **Test Names:** `TestMyLogic1`, `TestMyLogic2`

## EXPECTATION (For Testing)
[What must be true for this to be "Passed"?]
- Input 10 -> Output 20.
```

#### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | ✅ | `snake_case` slug | Unique identifier. Convention: `<type_lowercase>_<descriptive_slug>`. |
| `human_name` | ✅ | Quoted string | Human-readable title. |
| `type` | ✅ | Enum (see §1.3) | Categorization of the atom's role. |
| `layer` | ✅ | `BUSINESS` / `ARCHITECTURE` / `IMPLEMENTATION` | Which layer of the documentation hierarchy this atom belongs to (see §1.4). |
| `version` | ✅ | Semver (`1.0`) | Document version (currently advisory, see ISS-009). |
| `status` | ✅ | `DRAFT` / `REVIEW` / `STABLE` | Maturity level. |
| `priority` | ✅ | Integer `1`–`5` | Importance level. `1` = low priority, `5` = highest priority. |
| `tags` | ✅ | YAML list | Free-form keywords for search. |
| `parents` | ✅ | `[[atom_id]]` list | Upward dependency links. |
| `dependents` | ✅ | `[[atom_id]]` list | Downward dependency links (auto-populated by `atd weave`). |

#### Mandatory Sections (H2)

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `## INTENT` | Single-sentence "Why?" — must not contain "and" or "also". |
| `## THE RULE / LOGIC` | The core technical or functional specification. |
| `## TECHNICAL INTERFACE` | Linking information: API endpoints, `@spec-link` tags, test names, issue refs. |
| `## EXPECTATION` | Verifiable acceptance criteria for pass/fail testing. |

#### Granularity & Bloat Control

ATD enforces the **"Minimum Atomic Scale"** to prevent overly broad atoms. This is governed by two mechanisms:

**1. The "One Rule" Rule (Structural)**
- If a section of text contains more than one "state-changing rule" (e.g., a tax calculation AND a cooldown timer), it **must** be split into two atoms.
- If an `## INTENT` statement requires the word "and" or "also", the atom is too broad — split until the intent is a single, focused objective.

**2. Bloat Factor (Configurable)**

The `bloating_factor` in `.atd` config controls how strictly the automated auditor (`atd audit`) enforces granularity per type. It is a ratio between `0.0` and `1.0`:

| Factor | Meaning | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| `1.0` | **Strictest.** The atom must describe exactly one rule, one procedure, or one constraint. Any compound logic is flagged as bloat. | `RULE`, `MECHANIC` — pure logic atoms that must be surgical. |
| `0.7–0.8` | **Default.** Allows minor supporting context around the core rule. A small preamble or two closely related sub-points are tolerated. | Most types, general-purpose default. |
| `0.3–0.5` | **Relaxed.** The atom can contain several related rules or a broader narrative. Suitable for grouping types. | `MODULE`, `REQUIREMENT`, `SPECIFICATION` — naturally broader. |
| `0.1` | **Very relaxed.** Almost no bloat enforcement. The atom is expected to be long and narrative. | `USECASE`, `USER_STORY`, `API` — multi-step workflows or detailed contracts. |
| `0.0` | **No enforcement.** Bloat checking is effectively disabled. | Not recommended for production use. |

> **Rule of thumb for agents:** When creating an atom, check the `bloating_factor` for its type in `.atd` config. If the factor is high (≥0.7), keep the atom laser-focused on a single rule. If the factor is low (≤0.3), you have room for a richer, multi-point specification — but still aim for coherence around a single *topic*.

The per-type overrides are set in `.atd`:
```json
"bloating_factor": {
  "default": 0.8,
  "type_overrides": {
    "MODULE": 0.3,
    "REQUIREMENT": 0.3,
    "SPECIFICATION": 0.3,
    "USECASE": 0.1,
    "USER_STORY": 0.1,
    "API": 0.1
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Document Types

Atoms are grouped into **13 consolidated types** across three functional families. The **Bloat Factor** column maps to the default `bloating_factor` per type in `.atd` config (1.0 = strictest, 0.1 = most relaxed).

| Type | Family | Typical Layer | Bloat Factor | Granularity | `@spec-link` Placement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CONTRACT` | Governance | BUSINESS | 0.1 | **Unique**; project-wide mandatory rules | Root of Business layer |
| `VISION` | Governance | BUSINESS | 0.1 | **Unique**; project-wide scope/philosophy | Root of Business layer |
| `REQUIREMENT` | Requirements | BUSINESS | 0.3 | High-level external contract or constraint | Integration test suites |
| `USER_STORY` | Requirements | BUSINESS | 0.1 | User-facing workflow (synonym: `USECASE`, `WORKFLOW`) | Bloat-check relaxed |
| `RULE` | Logic | BUSINESS / ARCHITECTURE | 0.8 | Single business constraint or boolean check | At the validation point |
| `DOMAIN` | Logic | BUSINESS | 0.8 | Narrative-driven context: "The Why" | Documentation or orchestration files |
| `MECHANIC` | Logic | IMPLEMENTATION | 0.8 | One algorithm or procedural step | Above the implementation function |
| `MODULE` | Architectural | ARCHITECTURE | 0.3 | High-level grouping; broad scope is acceptable | Package/directory level or main entry point |
| `SERVICE` | Architectural | ARCHITECTURE | 0.3 | Command surface / service orchestration exposed by the system (CLI subcommand, MCP tool wrapper, provider) | Above the command handler or service entry point |
| `ENTITY` | Architectural | ARCHITECTURE | 0.8 | Single data structure or state model | Above type/struct definitions |
| `API` | Interface | ARCHITECTURE | 0.1 | One contract per atom; include sample payloads | Above route handler |
| `UI` | Interface | ARCHITECTURE | 0.8 | One screen or interaction flow | Near component definition |
| `SPECIFICATION` | Interface | ARCHITECTURE | 0.3 | Config schema, data schema, or interface specification (e.g. `.atd` config shape, payload schema) | Above the schema/config definition |

### 1.4 Project Governance: CONTRACT & VISION

`CONTRACT` and `VISION` are specialized, unique atoms that govern the evolution of the entire project.

1. **Uniqueness**: There must be exactly ONE `CONTRACT` atom and ONE `VISION` atom per project.
2. **Gating Role**:
    - **`CONTRACT`**: Represents the "hard" object of the project. It MUST be read whenever a `BUSINESS` layer atom is added, removed, or updated. It prevents the removal of atoms that are mandatory to the project's current stable setup.
    - **`VISION`**: Represents the "philosophical" object of the project. It MUST be read whenever a `BUSINESS` layer atom is added or updated. It prevents adding atoms that are beyond the project's intended purview (scope creep protection).
3. **Overrides**: While the user can override these gates, doing so REQUIRES that the `CONTRACT` and/or `VISION` atoms be updated to reflect the new state of the project.
4. **Bootstrapping**: If either is missing, the Agent MUST propose a definition based on the existing documentation and code.

### 1.5 Document Hierarchy & Layers

Atoms are organized into three **layers** that reflect the documentation's relationship to change and human oversight. This hierarchy is the backbone of ATD's traceability model.

```
  BUSINESS                    ARCHITECTURE                IMPLEMENTATION
  ─────────────────           ─────────────────           ─────────────────
  REQUIREMENT                 MODULE                      MECHANIC
  USER_STORY                  ENTITY                      RULE (technical)
  RULE (business)             API / UI
  DOMAIN

  Volatility: LOW ◄──────────────────────────────────────────────► HIGH
  Human gate: HEAVY                MODERATE                    LIGHT
```

#### BUSINESS Layer

Atoms that capture **what the business wants and why**. These include requirements, user stories, business rules, and domain context.

- **Volatility:** Low. Once `STABLE`, these atoms are near-immutable. Alterations require high precautions and heavy human involvement (stakeholder sign-off, formal change requests).
- **Typical types:** `REQUIREMENT`, `USER_STORY`, `RULE` (business constraints), `DOMAIN`.
- **Traceability role:** The **origin** of the traceability chain. Every `ARCHITECTURE` and `IMPLEMENTATION` atom should trace back to a `BUSINESS` atom.

#### ARCHITECTURE Layer

Atoms that capture **how the system is designed** to fulfill customer requirements. These include high-level modules, service orchestrators, entity definitions, API contracts, and UI flow designs.

- **Volatility:** Moderate. May be revised when unforeseen technical problems arise, but once stabilized they tend to remain fixed. Changes should trigger impact analysis (`atd crawl`).
- **Typical types:** `MODULE`, `SERVICE`, `ENTITY`, `API`, `UI`, `RULE` (architectural constraints).
- **Traceability role:** The **bridge** between customer intent and code reality.

#### IMPLEMENTATION Layer

Atoms that capture **how the code works in practice**. These include mechanics, data schemas, build pipelines, and developer-facing guides. These atoms evolve as the code is implemented, tested, and refactored.

- **Volatility:** High. Expected to change frequently during development. Subject to the doc-code co-evolution principle (§1.1, point 3).
- **Typical types:** `MECHANIC`, `DATA`, `BUILD`, `USAGE` (dev guides), `RULE` (technical constraints).
- **Traceability role:** The **leaf nodes** — linked directly to source code via `@spec-link` and to tests via `@test-link`. Must have at least one ancestor in the BUSINESS layer (enforced by the pre-commit hook via `parents:` field).

### 1.5 Relationships & Graph Model

ATD builds a **bidirectional dependency graph** between atoms and between atoms and source code.

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   MODULE     │  (high-level)
                    └──────┬───────┘
               parents: ▲  │  ▼ :dependents
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
     ┌─────┴──────┐  ┌─────┴──────┐  ┌────┴───────┐
     │  SERVICE    │  │   RULE     │  │  ENTITY    │
     └─────┬──────┘  └─────┬──────┘  └────┬───────┘

     @spec-link       @spec-link      @spec-link
           │               │               │
     ┌─────┴──────┐  ┌─────┴──────┐  ┌────┴───────┐
     │  handler.go │  │ validate.go│  │  model.go  │  (source code)
     └─────┬──────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘
           │
     @test-link
           │
     ┌─────┴──────┐
     │handler_test │  (test code)
     └────────────┘
```

#### Link types

| Tag | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `parents: [[id]]` | Atom → Atom (upward) | "This atom is governed by…" |
| `dependents: [[id]]` | Atom → Atom (downward) | "These atoms depend on me…" (auto-populated by `weave`) |
| `@spec-link [[id]]` | Code → Atom | "This code implements…" |
| `@test-link [[id]]` | Test → Atom | "This test verifies…" |

#### Surgical Attachment Rules (for `@spec-link`)

1. **NO Global Headers:** Do not place `@spec-link` in the file header unless the atom represents the ENTIRE architectural pattern of the file.
2. **Logic Boundaries:** Place tags immediately above class definitions, decorators, or major logical blocks.
3. **Granularity Match:** If an atom describes a specific sub-feature, the tag goes only at the start of that specific section, NOT at the top of the file.

### 1.6 Lifecycle

ATD operates across two distinct lifecycle contexts: the **cold-start** (bootstrapping) and the **day-to-day** development cycle.

#### Cold Start (Bootstrapping an undocumented codebase)

Used once, at project inception or when onboarding ATD to a legacy codebase.

```
roadmap → index → dissect → weave → discover → recon → audit
```

| Step | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Complexity scan | `roadmap` | Identify high-density files to prioritize. |
| 2. Semantic index | `index` | Build the vector DB for search and matching. |
| 3. Dissection | `dissect` | Break source files into proposed atom boundaries. |
| 4. Graph weave | `weave` | Establish bidirectional parent/dependent links. |
| 5. Auto-tagging | `discover` | Recommend `@spec-link` placements in code. |
| 6. Validation | `recon` | Confirm that discovered links are correct. |
| 7. Full audit | `audit` | Check for bloat, collisions, and orphans. |

> The `atd-cold-start.sh <project_dir>` script orchestrates this full pipeline.

#### Day-to-Day Development Lifecycle

Once the ATD base is established, atoms and code co-evolve through recurring stages:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Stage | Context | Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Plan** | Feature request, brainstorm, early iteration | `query`, `search`, `assemble` | Explore existing atoms, identify related specs, brainstorm new features. Create `DRAFT` atoms for ideas still "in the air" — these document what's *being considered* without committing to implementation. Use `assemble` to pull together context for planning sessions. |
| **Specify** | Requirements & design | `update` (create), `weave` | Create or update atoms: `REQUIREMENT`, `USECASE`, `SPECIFICATION`, `MODULE`, `SERVICE`, etc. Set `status: DRAFT`. Link to parent atoms. Run `weave` to maintain the graph. |
| **Implement** | Investigation, Coding & testing | `trace`, `update`, `discover` | **Investigation Phase:** Before modifying any code, the agent MUST run `atd_trace(atom=..., summary=true)` to get a 500-word narrative assessment of the atom's vertical context and impact. Write code, annotate with `@spec-link [[atom_id]]` and `@test-link [[atom_id]]`. Update `IMPLEMENTATION`-layer atoms (`MECHANIC`, etc.) as code solidifies. Promote atoms to `REVIEW` when implementation is ready. |
| **Verify** | Validation | `audit`, `verify`, `test-links`, `crawl --gaps` | Run `verify` to check code-spec alignment. Run `audit` for bloat and collisions. Run `test-links` to confirm test coverage per atom. Run `crawl --gaps` to find orphaned atoms. |
| **Evolve** | Change management | `crawl`, `trace`, `update` | Before modifying an atom, run `atd_crawl` for blast radius (structural) and `atd_trace(summary=true)` for vertical context (semantic). Apply surgical edits via `update`. Promote stable atoms to `STABLE`. |

#### Status Transitions

Atoms move through maturity levels as they are refined:

```
DRAFT ──► REVIEW ──► STABLE ──► (DEPRECATED) ──► (ARCHIVED)
  │          │          │
  └──────────┴──────────┘  (can demote if spec changes)
```

- **DRAFT:** Initial ideas, brainstorming artifacts, early specs. Low validation overhead.
- **REVIEW:** Ready for peer or stakeholder validation. Subject to audit checks.
- **STABLE:** Approved and enforced. Code must comply. Changes require impact analysis.
- **DEPRECATED / ARCHIVED:** End-of-life (see ISS-033).

> **Layer-specific governance:** `BUSINESS` layer atoms at `STABLE` require heavy human sign-off to modify. `ARCHITECTURE` atoms require impact analysis. `IMPLEMENTATION` atoms can be updated more freely as code evolves.

### 1.7 Configuration

All tools read from a **`.atd`** JSON file at project root (created by `atd init`).

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs_path` | Relative path to the ATD docs folder. |
| `diff_similarity_threshold` | Cosine similarity threshold for collision detection (0.0–1.0). |
| `bloating_factor.default` | Default bloat tolerance. 1.0 = strict one-rule, 0.0 = no limit. |
| `bloating_factor.type_overrides` | Per-type overrides (e.g., `USECASE: 0.1` = very relaxed). |
| `llm.providers` | Ordered provider chain: `remote` → `local` → `ide_agent` passthrough. |
| `llm.models` | Map of model names to their assigned task types (e.g., `dissect`, `embed`, `audit_bloat`). |
| `llm.fallback_model` | Default model when no task-specific model is found. |
| `logging.log_path` | Path for centralized ATD tool logging. |

> **Note:** `atd init` is a one-time filesystem bootstrap and is NOT exposed as an MCP tool.

---

## 2. MCP Toolset Reference

The `atd serve` command starts a JSON-RPC 2.0 / MCP (spec 2025-11-25) server via two transports:

- **stdio** (default): `atd serve` — host launches as subprocess.
- **HTTP**: `atd serve --http --port 7474` — single `/mcp` endpoint.

The server currently exposes **25 tools**.

### VS Code Configuration (`.mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "atd": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/atd",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 2.1 Deterministic Tools

These tools NEVER call an LLM. They are safe, cheap, and fast.

---

#### `atd_query`

**Purpose:** Search atoms by frontmatter field value.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search` | string | ✅ | Value to match (case-insensitive substring). |
| `field` | string | ❌ | Frontmatter field to search (e.g., `type`, `status`, `id`, `layer`, `tags`). Omit to search all fields. |

**Output:** JSON array of matching atoms with full frontmatter.

**When to use:** During **Plan** stage to find existing atoms before creating new ones, or to locate all atoms matching a criteria.

---

#### `atd_crawl`

**Purpose:** Build a dependency graph of ATD atoms and their `@spec-link` connections to source code.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gaps` | boolean | ❌ | If `true`, return only `STABLE` atoms with zero code implementations (orphan detection). |

**Output:** Full dependency graph JSON (atoms → code links, parent/dependent edges). With `gaps=true`, only orphan atoms.

**When to use:**
- During **Evolve** stage before modifying a high-level atom, to understand ripple effects (blast radius analysis).
- During **Verify** stage to find `STABLE` atoms with no code implementations.

---

#### `atd_weave`

**Purpose:** Populate the `dependents[]` array in all atoms by scanning `parents` references. Establishes the bidirectional graph.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | — | — | Operates on the full docs directory. |

**Output:** Confirmation of weaving results (number of links created).

**When to use:**
- After creating or modifying atoms (especially `parents` fields).
- As part of any creation pipeline to ensure the graph is consistent.

---

#### `atd_update`

**Purpose:** Surgically modify an ATD file without LLM rewriting. Also injects `@spec-link` tags into source files.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | ❌ | Path to the `.atom.md` file. Either `file` or `filter` must be provided. |
| `filter` | string | ❌ | Filter atoms to update natively (e.g., `'type=RULE,status=DRAFT'`). Mutually exclusive with `file`. |
| `set` | string[] | ❌ | Frontmatter edits as `key=value` pairs (e.g., `["status=STABLE", "priority=CORE"]`). |
| `intent` | string | ❌ | New `## INTENT` section text. |
| `logic` | string | ❌ | New `## THE RULE / LOGIC` section text. |
| `interface` | string | ❌ | New `## TECHNICAL INTERFACE` section text. |
| `expectation` | string | ❌ | New `## EXPECTATION` section text. |
| `spec_link` | string | ❌ | Atom ID to prepend as `@spec-link` in a source file (requires `spec_link_file`). |
| `spec_link_file` | string | ❌ | Source file path for `@spec-link` injection. |

**Output:** Confirmation of fields updated. If `id` or `type` is changed, file is renamed and all `[[old_id]]` references are propagated.

**When to use:**
- **MANDATORY** for editing existing `.atom.md` files. Do NOT rewrite the whole file.
- Changing status, priority, or any frontmatter field.
- **Batch Processing:** Use `filter` instead of `file` to apply the same update to all matching files atomically via a single call.
- Injecting `@spec-link` tags into source code without manual editing.
- Creating new atoms (provide the file path and all required fields).

---

#### `atd_roadmap`

**Purpose:** Scan a source directory and produce a complexity map ranking files by density.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dir` | string | ✅ | Directory to scan. |
| `out` | string | ❌ | Optional output file path for `roadmap.json`. |

**Output:** JSON roadmap with files ranked by complexity (lines, cyclomatic density, function count).

**When to use:** During cold-start **Plan** stage to prioritize which files to dissect first.

---

#### `atd_stats`

**Purpose:** Produce quantitative documentation health metrics: total atoms, atoms by type, status, domain, coverage ratio, and orphan count.

|---|---|---|---|
| `workspace` | boolean | ❌ | If `true`, aggregate stats from all projects in the workspace. |

**Output:** JSON report with quantitative health metrics (per-project when workspace=true).

### 2.2 LLM-Backed Tools

These tools require an Ollama provider (local or remote) or fall back to IDE Agent passthrough. They consume tokens.

---

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | ✅ | Path to the source or documentation file to dissect. |

**Output:** JSON array of proposed atom boundaries with suggested IDs, types, and line ranges. Falls back to a structured prompt for IDE Agent processing if no Ollama provider is available.

**When to use:**

- After significant code or documentation changes to refresh the index.
- Uses `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings. Files unchanged since last indexing are automatically skipped (mtime-based caching).
- **Stale Entry Cleanup:** Automatically removes index entries for files that have been deleted from disk.
- **Chunk Length Handling:** Implements robust splitting to prevent context-length overflows on large files.

---

#### `atd_search`

**Purpose:** Search the project semantically or by keyword.

| `limit` | integer | ❌ | Number of semantic results to return (default: 5). |

**Output:** Ranked results with similarity scores and file context.

**When to use:**
- During **Plan** stage to find related code or atoms by meaning, or to locate implementations when atom IDs are unknown.

---

#### `atd_audit`

**Purpose:** Audit ATD atoms for documentation quality issues.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

- **Model:** `qwen2.5-coder:14b`.

---

#### `atd_map`

**Purpose:** Three-mode tool for linking source code to ATD atoms. CLI equivalent: `atd map`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | ✅ | Path to the source file to analyse. |
| `atom` | string | ❌ | **Confirm mode:** atom ID to validate against the file. Returns a confidence score and rationale. |
| `new` | boolean | ❌ | **Propose mode:** return a new atom skeleton (id, type, layer, intent, logic) ready to pass to `atd_update`. |

**Modes:**
- **Default** (`file` only): Searches existing atoms for candidates and recommends `@spec-link` placements following surgical attachment rules.
- **Confirm** (`file` + `atom`): Validates whether the file implements the given atom. Equivalent to `atd_recon` but accepts an atom ID instead of a file path.
- **Propose** (`file` + `new: true`): Extracts architectural intent and proposes a brand-new atom skeleton when no existing atom fits.

**When to use:**
- **Default:** During **Implement** stage to link new or legacy files to the right atoms.
- **Confirm:** Before applying `@spec-link` tags during cold-start or after refactoring to verify the match.

## 3. Agent Behavioral Rules (Intransigence Guidelines)

To maintain graph integrity, all agents MUST follow these "hard behavioral triggers":

### 3.1 The "No Parent, No Code" Rule
If the user asks to implement a feature or mechanic:
1. **Search**: You MUST first execute `atd_search` to find relevant atoms.
2. **Verify Ancestry**: Check if a parent `BUSINESS` or `ARCHITECTURE` atom exists for this feature.
3. **STOP**: If no such parent exists, **STOP**. Do not write code. Do not write the `IMPLEMENTATION` atom.
4. **Interview**: You must first propose the missing `BUSINESS`/`ARCHITECTURE` atoms to the user and ask for their approval to create them.

### 3.2 Governance Check
Before adding or modifying any `BUSINESS` layer atom, you MUST read the project's `CONTRACT` and `VISION` atoms.
- If the change violates the `CONTRACT` (removal of mandatory features) or `VISION` (scope creep), you must warn the user and require explicit confirmation.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis & Recommendations

The following gaps and improvement opportunities are identified from the current backlog, system analysis, and real-world usage patterns.

### 3.1 Already Tracked in Backlog

These issues are already filed and represent known gaps:

| Ref | Gap | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **ISS-009** | **Version management is ignored.** The `version` field is parsed but never used for conflict resolution or latest-version selection. | Multiple versions of the same atom can silently coexist. |
| **ISS-010** | **Status has no enforcement.** `DRAFT`, `REVIEW`, `STABLE` are labels without workflow logic. No gated transitions, no stricter validation for `STABLE`. | All atoms are treated equally regardless of maturity. |
| **ISS-002, ISS-027** | **Dissection granularity is too coarse.** `atd dissect` produces few, bloated boundaries for complex files. | Atoms violate the "One Rule" principle after cold-start. |
| **ISS-025** | **Creation produces sparse atoms.** `atd update` only populates `intent`; `parents`, `version`, `logic`, and `expectation` are left empty. | New atoms are incomplete and require manual cleanup. |
| **ISS-019** | **API atoms lose payload details.** `type: API` atoms created from detailed contracts capture only a subset of the specification. | API documentation is unreliable for contract verification. |
| **ISS-030** | **No targeted impact analysis.** `atd crawl` returns the entire graph; no `--target` flag for scoped ripple-effect analysis. | Architects cannot quickly assess the blast radius of a change. |
| **ISS-014** | **Issues and atoms are disconnected.** No machine-readable link between `issues/` and `docs/` atoms. | Technical debt is invisible when viewing a spec, and vice versa. |
| **ISS-011** | **Generation orchestration is weak.** The dissect → generate → audit pipeline is not unified; agents often bypass the tooling. | Inconsistent atom quality; wasted cloud LLM tokens. |
| **ISS-013** | **Lack of self-documentation.** The ATD project does not dogfood its own framework comprehensively. | New contributors face a steep onboarding curve. |

### 3.2 New Gaps Identified

Beyond the backlog, the following capabilities would round out ATD as a comprehensive documentation governance tool:

#### 3.2.1 Atom Deprecation & Archival

**Problem:** There is no `DEPRECATED` or `ARCHIVED` status. When a feature is removed, the corresponding atom lingers as `STABLE` with no formal lifecycle end.

**Recommendation:** Add `DEPRECATED` and `ARCHIVED` statuses. `DEPRECATED` atoms should trigger warnings in `atd audit` if code still links to them. `ARCHIVED` atoms should be excluded from all tool outputs unless explicitly queried.

#### 3.2.2 Change History / Changelog per Atom

**Problem:** Atoms have a `version` field but no change log. When an atom is modified, there is no record of what changed, when, or why.

**Recommendation:** Implement a sidecar `<atom_id>.changelog.json` file (co-located next to the `.atom.md`). `atd update` should auto-append an entry (timestamp, field changed, old → new value, user/agent) whenever a field is modified. This is critical for `STABLE` atoms where traceability of spec changes is a governance requirement. The sidecar approach avoids polluting the atom file itself and allows tooling to parse change history independently.

#### 3.2.3 Cross-Project Atom Sharing

**Problem:** ATD is currently single-project. There is no mechanism for sharing atoms between repositories (e.g., a shared `DOMAIN` atom for company-wide business rules).

**Recommendation:** Support a `refs` or `imports` section in `.atd` config that points to external atom repositories (git URLs or local paths). `atd crawl` and `atd search` should resolve cross-project links. This also requires upgrading the tooling to handle **destination selection** — when creating or linking atoms, the user must be able to specify which project/repository the atom belongs to. Multi-repository projects would benefit significantly from this capability.


#### 3.2.7 Atom Templates per Type

**Problem:** All atoms use the same generic template. `API` atoms would benefit from built-in request/response schema sections; `USECASE` atoms need a `## WORKFLOW` section; `USER_STORY` atoms need `## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA`.

**Recommendation:** `atd update` should apply type-specific templates when creating new atoms. Templates for `USECASE` and `USER_STORY` already exist in the skill but are not integrated into the CLI/MCP tooling.

#### 3.2.8 Conflict Resolution During Reconciliation

**Problem:** When new external requirements arrive that semantically overlap with existing atoms, there is no structured merge/conflict resolution protocol beyond manual review.

**Recommendation:** Formalize the Reconciler sub-mode as an MCP tool (`atd_reconcile`) that: (1) searches for semantically similar existing atoms, (2) classifies the overlap as `MERGE`, `UPDATE`, or `NEW`, and (3) presents the options to the agent/user. This tool currently exists as a CLI concept (`atd reconcile`) but is not exposed via MCP.

#### 3.2.9 Crawl Summary & Graph Visualization

**Problem:** The dependency graph from `atd crawl` is a raw JSON blob. There is no standard way to render it visually for architecture reviews, and no way to get a human-readable summary of the findings.

**Recommendation:**
1. **Summary output:** `atd crawl` should produce a structured summary of all extracted information alongside the graph — total atoms, link counts, orphans, coverage stats, and key findings. This summary should be included in the default output, not behind a flag.
2. **Mermaid export:** Add a `--format mermaid` flag to `atd crawl` that outputs the graph as a Mermaid diagram, directly embeddable in Markdown documents and renderable by most Markdown viewers. Mermaid format is sufficient; Graphviz/DOT is not required.
3. **WebUI integration:** The WebUI should consume this graph data for interactive exploration.

#### 3.2.10 WebUI Specification

**Problem:** The WebUI currently exists only as a kernel of an idea — basic rendering with no formal specification, no connection to the ATD binary tools, and no defined user experience.

**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive specification for the WebUI as a set of ATD atoms (`MODULE`, `UI`, `SERVICE` types). This should cover: graph visualization, atom CRUD operations, audit dashboards, cold-start orchestration, and integration with the `atd` CLI/MCP tooling. The specification should be built before further UI development begins.
