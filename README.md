# Upsilon: A Multi-Service Game Platform

**Upsilon** is a multi-service game platform, umbrella-repo'd across Git submodules and governed end to end by the Atomic Traceable Documentation (ATD) framework. Today it ships one live game — **UpsilonBattle**, a turn-based Tactical RPG (TRPG) for concurrent multiplayer combat and AI skirmishes — served through a shared platform gateway (`upsilonhub`) alongside extracted substrate services for identity (`upsilonauth`) and economy (`upsiloneconomy`). The v3 trajectory grows this into a four-game platform (battle, tycoon, spy, digital) composed on shared platform substrates and vocabularies, with the standing rule that **games never import games**. The full architecture reference set — service ownership map, platform direction, and the [playbook for adding a new service](architecture/how_to_add_a_service.md) — starts at [`architecture/INDEX.md`](architecture/INDEX.md).

## Battle: The Game At a Glance
- **Play Modes:** 1v1 (PvE or PvP) and 2v2 (PvE or PvP).
- **The Board:** A randomly generated rectangular grid (5-15 tiles per dimension, absolute minimum area of 50 tiles) containing up to 10% randomly placed impassable obstacles.
- **Victory Condition:** Eliminate all characters on the opposing team. **Friendly Fire is strictly disabled.**
- **The Roster:** Every player commands a roster of exactly 3 characters.

## Character System & Progression
- **Initial Core Roll:** New characters start with base stats (3 HP, 1 Move, 1 Attack, 1 Def) and exactly 4 additional points are randomly dispatched (Total 10 points). 
- **The Reroll Mechanic:** During account registration, players are granted an option to completely re-randomize their 3 initial character stat blocks. This reroll can be executed a strict maximum of **3 times**.
- **Stat Progression:** Securing a match victory rewards a player with 1 Attribute Point. 
  - **Constraints:** Total attributes cannot exceed `10 + total wins`. Matches result in a maximum of 1 point gain.
  - **Movement Restriction:** Upgrading the Movement attribute is heavily throttled and locked to once every 5 accumulated wins.

## Combat Mechanics
- **Initiative & Delay:** Turn order is non-linear. Characters roll a pre-initiative value ranging from `1-500`. Active turns fire when the ticker hits `0`. 
- **Action Economy:** During a turn, a character may perform a maximum of **1 Move** (`+20/tile`), **1 Attack** (`+100`), or safely **Pass** (`+300`). Performing actions accumulates a numerical "Delay Cost," mathematically extending the wait time until that character's next sequence.
- **The Shot Clock:** Active combat turns mandate a strict **30-second limit** per character. Failing to confirm an action manually results in an auto-pass forced by the server, accompanied by a penalty of `+100` (Total `+400` delay).

## Modular Architecture
The Upsilon platform is built as a modular multi-repo system. Each core component is maintained in its own repository and integrated into this umbrella project as a formal **Git Submodule** (`upsilonserializer` is the one exception — an in-tree Go module, not a submodule).

### Repository Structure
1. **Frontend (`upsilonbattleui`)**:
   - Standalone Vue 3 + Vite SPA (vue-router, Tailwind CSS, TresJS 3D) — the player/battle client plus the admin pages.
   - Served by the hub; talks to `/api/v1` with bearer tokens and listens on the SSE event stream.

2. **Platform Gateway (`upsilonhub`)**:
   - Go service — the platform gateway hosting the remaining platform substrates and game modules as packages (matchmaking, admin, character, realtime SSE, the database schema, and today's only shipped game module: battle).
   - One image serves the API + SPA, runs migrations (`-migrate-mode`) and seeds (`-seed`).

3. **Identity Service (`upsilonauth`)**:
   - Extracted auth/identity substrate (SSO-bound target). Owns accounts, tokens, admin user registry and per-account service registrations; the hub validates tokens against it over S2S. Registering never implies enrollment — an account binds to a game only through that game's own opt-in enroll call, surfaced via the hub's games catalog (`GET /api/v1/games`) and the SPA's game-selection page; enrollment is additive-only, never revoked.

4. **Economy Service (`upsiloneconomy`)**:
   - Extracted economy substrate — wallets, ledger, purchases/awards — consumed by the hub (and, over time, every game) over the internal S2S surface.

5. **Platform Kit (`upsilonplatform`)**:
   - Shared mechanical kit (envelope/`respond`, injected clock, observability/OTel setup, database, durable jobs, S2S `httpx`) that every extracted service composes on, so new services are born instrumented instead of copy-drifting the plumbing.

6. **Backend API (`upsilonapi`)**:
   - The battle engine's "Bridge" — a high-performance Go JSON API handling match state, engine callbacks and account/character statistics for the battle game.

7. **Battle Engine (`upsilonbattle`)**:
   - The "calculating brain" that governs active combat sequences.
   - Mathematically simulates initiative, movement validation, and damage systems.

8. **Journey Explorer CLI (`upsiloncli`)**:
   - An interactive terminal tool for API exploration and verification.
   - Supports "Autopilot" sessions to simulate full player journeys.

9. **Shared Assets & Utilities**:
   - `upsilonmapdata`: Geometric board data and obstacle definitions.
   - `upsilonmapmaker`: Procedural generation tools for game boards.
   - `upsilontools`: Common TRPG utilities and helper functions.
   - `upsilontypes`: Shared type definitions and domain models used across all modules.
   - `upsilonserializer`: In-tree (non-submodule) Go module for engine-state serialization.

10. **AWS Infrastructure (`upsilonaws`)**:
   - Bash-based provisioning scripts for deploying the full stack to AWS (eu-west-3).
   - Manages: VPC, EC2 (t3.medium), RDS PostgreSQL 15, Route 53 DNS, nginx + Let's Encrypt SSL.
   - Public endpoint: [upsilon-hub.com](https://upsilon-hub.com) — run `setup.sh` to provision, `teardown.sh` to wipe everything.
   - Designed for pay-per-session use (~$0.075/hour, $0.50/month for Route 53 zone).

## Setup

The Upsilon project is a complex ecosystem. For a detailed guide on how to prepare your environment, install dependencies, and configure the system, please refer to the **[Setup Documentation](Setup.md)**.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Project
Since the project relies on submodules, you must clone recursively to fetch all components:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ecumeurs/upsilonumbrella.git
```
If you have already cloned the repository, initialize the submodules with:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Development & Monitoring

#### DevContainer Environment
The project provides a pre-configured development environment via **[.devcontainer/](.devcontainer/)**. This is the recommended way to develop for Upsilon, ensuring a consistent environment across all platforms.

- **Stack:** Go, Node.js 20.
- **Tools:** Postgres client and ATD integration tools.
- **Port Forwarding:**
  - `8085`: Caddy front door (hub API + SSE + SPA)
  - `8090`: Upsilon Hub (direct)
  - `8091`: Upsilon Auth (identity/SSO, direct)
  - `8092`: Upsilon Economy (internal-only, direct)
  - `8081`: Upsilon Engine (Go API)
  - `5173`: Vue Frontend (Vite dev server, HMR)

> **Running hub feature tests:** they boot throwaway Postgres containers via
> testcontainers — Docker must be reachable from the environment running
> `go test ./upsilonhub/...`.

#### Service Management
The project includes a suite of scripts in the `scripts/` directory for local service management and testing.

**First-time dev bring-up sequence** (inside the devcontainer):
```bash
./scripts/build_services.sh   # build engine, hub, CLI binaries + SPA
./scripts/seed_ci.sh          # migrate (-migrate-mode full) + seed a fresh DB — required once
./scripts/start_services.sh   # launch engine (:8081), hub (:8090), Vite (:5173)
./scripts/trigger_one_ci_test.sh e2e_customer_onboarding   # run one CLI-backed e2e test
```
> The hub does **not** auto-migrate on boot; `seed_ci.sh` is the one-shot that
> applies the schema and seeds the catalog / test accounts. `trigger_one_ci_test.sh`
> drives the CLI in `--local` mode, which targets the hub directly on `:8090`.

- **[scripts/start_services.sh](scripts/start_services.sh)**: Launches the full Upsilon stack (Upsilon Engine, Upsilon Hub, and Vite dev server) in the background. It automatically verifies that all ports are listening before exiting.
- **[scripts/stop_services.sh](scripts/stop_services.sh)**: Gracefully stops all tracked services and ensures ports are freed.
- **[scripts/check_services.sh](scripts/check_services.sh)**: Lightweight status utility for quick health checks of the local stack.
- **[scripts/watch_services.go](scripts/watch_services.go)**: Real-time TUI dashboard for monitoring CPU/Mem usage and recent errors across all services. Run with `go run scripts/watch_services.go`.
- **[scripts/trigger_all_ci_tests.sh](scripts/trigger_all_ci_tests.sh)**: Executes the full local test suite (E2E + Edge Cases) against the running local stack.

#### Development Utilities
- **[scripts/build_services.sh](scripts/build_services.sh)**: Rebuilds the core binaries (Engine, Hub, CLI) and the SPA bundle.
- **[scripts/clear_matches.sh](scripts/clear_matches.sh)**: Authoritatively clears active match records from the database and engine cache.
- **[scripts/seed_ci.sh](scripts/seed_ci.sh)**: Resets and seeds the database with standard CI testing data.
- **[scripts/zombie_killer.sh](scripts/zombie_killer.sh)**: Forcefully kills any orphaned Upsilon processes (CLI bots, detached engines).
- **[scripts/stress_test.py](scripts/stress_test.py)**: High-concurrency performance orchestration script for load testing.
- **[scripts/repo_status.sh](scripts/repo_status.sh)**: One-shot source-control health check across the umbrella **and all submodules** — branch, short HEAD, push-sync (ahead/behind upstream), submodule-pointer coherence, and working-tree cleanliness, in a single aligned table. Pass `--fetch` to refresh remote-tracking refs first. Exits non-zero if any repo is dirty, has unpushed commits, lacks an upstream, or the umbrella points at a commit that isn't the submodule's checked-out HEAD — making it a handy **pre-/post-push preflight** for this multi-repo tree.

## Continuous Integration & Quality control

UpsilonBattle employs a robust CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, architectural integrity, and business rule compliance.

### Automated Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
A single **CI Pipeline** runs three staged jobs on push / PR to `main`:
- **Build & Lint**: static analysis (Go vet), verifies all core components build, and checks the Docker images.
- **Go Unit Tests**: Go unit tests for all backend modules (including the hub's testcontainers feature suites).
- **Integration & E2E**: orchestrates the ephemeral [docker-compose.ci.yaml](docker-compose.ci.yaml) stack and runs the `upsiloncli` customer + edge scenario suites — specialized CLI bots simulating real player journeys through the hub and engine.

### Code Health Standards (`scripts/code_health_check.py`)
Upsilon defines strict maintainability standards across all supported languages (Go, Python, JS, TypeScript, Vue, PHP). The checker is **available but not automated**: it is not wired into the pre-commit hook (currently disabled there) and is not run in CI. It should be run **manually at the end of each development session** — `python3 scripts/code_health_check.py [path]`, where `path` is a single file or a directory (defaults to the current directory) — to keep code quality from degrading over time. A full-repo run completes in well under a second.

- **File Length:** Warning above 400 effective LOC, Error above 600 LOC.
- **Complexity:** Function nesting depth must not exceed 4 levels.
- **Documentation:** Every function needs an intent comment; missing docs on exported functions is an Error.
- **ATD Traceability:** Each file must link 1-10 distinct ATD atoms via `@spec-link`/`@test-link` tags (warn above 5 distinct). Repeating the same atom ID across multiple tags counts once, not per occurrence. Under 1 or over 10 distinct atoms results in an Error.
- **Validity:** All `@spec-link` IDs must resolve to a valid ATD Atom in the `docs/` directory.

**Exemptions:**
Individual checks can be bypassed using specific tags:
- `@lint-ignore-file-bloating`
- `@lint-ignore-complexity`
- `@lint-ignore-documentation`
- `@lint-ignore-atd`

### CI Infrastructure (Docker Stack)
The project utilizes a dedicated **[docker-compose.ci.yaml](docker-compose.ci.yaml)** to spin up an ephemeral testing environment. This stack is optimized for speed and reliability.

- **Components:**
  - `db`: Postgres 18-alpine database (per-service DBs: `upsilon`, `upsilonauth`, `upsiloneconomy`, on one shared Postgres instance).
  - `hub-migrate` / `hub-seed`: hub-image init containers (schema + seed).
  - `hub`: the platform gateway serving API + SSE + SPA; reaches `auth`/`economy` over S2S.
  - `auth-migrate` / `auth-seed` / `auth`: the extracted `upsilonauth` identity service.
  - `economy-migrate` / `economy-seed` / `economy`: the extracted `upsiloneconomy` service.
  - `proxy`: Caddy front door on `:8085` (its healthcheck gates the stack; routes `/api/v1/auth/*` and `/api/v1/admin/users*` straight to `auth`).
  - `engine`: The Upsilon Battle Engine (Go).
  - `tester`: The Upsilon CLI running in integration mode.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yaml up -d --wait
  ```

- **CI Reports**: Each run generates a summary report ([ci_report.sh](tests/ci_report.sh)) that is attached to the job summary, providing immediate visibility into test outcomes and compliance status.

## Specification (ATD) Maps
All fundamental mechanics, structural constraints, entities, and network rules that form the game are housed individually within the project-specific `docs/` folders (e.g., `upsilonapi/docs/`, `upsilonbattle/docs/`) governed by the ATD Workspace. These Atoms serve as the uncompromising basis for evaluating developer implementation logic.
